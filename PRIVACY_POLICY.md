# Privacy Policy for SpectreTV

**Last Updated: December 13, 2024**

## Introduction

SpectreTV ("we", "our", or "the app") is an IPTV player application. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our application.

## Information Collection

### Data Stored Locally

SpectreTV stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

- **IPTV Source Credentials**: Server URLs, usernames, and passwords for Xtream Codes services, and M3U playlist URLs that you add to the app
- **Watch History**: Records of content you have watched for resume functionality
- **Favorites**: Channels, movies, and series you mark as favorites
- **App Preferences**: Your settings and preferences within the app

### Data NOT Collected

We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. Specifically:

- We do not collect personal identification information
- We do not track your viewing habits remotely
- We do not use analytics services
- We do not share any data with third parties
- We do not use advertising SDKs

## Data Storage and Security

All data is stored locally on your device using Android's standard secure storage mechanisms. Your IPTV credentials and viewing data never leave your device through our app.

## Third-Party Services

SpectreTV connects to IPTV services that **you** configure. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third-party IPTV providers. Please review the privacy policies of any IPTV service you choose to use.

## Network Connections

The app makes network connections only to:

- IPTV servers you configure (to fetch channel lists and stream content)
- Image URLs provided by your IPTV service (for channel logos and content posters)

## Children's Privacy

SpectreTV does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app is intended for general audiences to access their own IPTV subscriptions.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete all app data by:

- Clearing the app's data through Android Settings
- Uninstalling the application

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.
